TASK1 Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

Even or Odd Checker
This project is a basic Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then tells whether the number is Even or Odd. It is a simple beginner-level program made for practicing user input and conditional statements.
OUTPUT:
Enter an integer: 49
49 is an Odd number

TASK2 Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This project is a basic Python program that calculates the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 50. It uses a simple loop to add each number step-by-step and then displays the final result. This is a beginner-friendly program made for practicing loops and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
OUTPUT:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
